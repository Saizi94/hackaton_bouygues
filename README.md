## General informations

Objectif : Find a way to innovate about the Bouygues API

We want to use the mobile data informations given by the Bouygues API.

The goal of our product is to warn about the internet data consumption on a Bouygues telecom client's mobile phone.

In the first step we need to recover the mobile data of a connected client.
Then we need to stock them and analyse them to find tendances / averages, and highlight the unnatural mobile data usage.
Then we need to warn the client about his data usage and maybe redirect him to connected Bouygues telecom offers.

## Technicals informations

Our solution will be represented by an API and a mobile application.

In the first hand, for the API:

- We are gonna use Django Python Framework :
Because we need a back language to make the whole API
Because Python is good language to deal with maths, numbers, averages, etc...

In the second hand, for the Mobile Application:

- We are gonna use Flutter :
Because is more convenient to build on IOS and Android
Because we need a simple application
